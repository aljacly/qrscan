## My process

I first tried making the qr code image with white borders, and putting the captions underneath the image with its own white background. It looked like two white boxes. I then removed the background for the captions and put the text over the image and border using using the top, left and transform CSS properties. 

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 

### What I learned

I learned how to put text over images and borders using the positon properties, and how I can fill in the gaps that border-radius leaves behind with a identical background colour of the border. 

### Continued development
As a complete beginner to HTML and CSS, I struggle with understanding how to position elements with CSS. I want to improve my understanding of how margins and positions (absolute, relative, etc) work, as well as learning how to use other forms of measurement other than px.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I used w3schools to learn the basics of HTML and CSS.
